			<h1>The most important problems in Ai</h1>
			<p>NOTE: Take this post written by a complete nobody with a grain of salt, if i was wrong about something here, email me, i want to hear it.</p>
			<p>These are the problems in Ai that if fixed, would cause a massive change in the scale of the industrial revolution, these are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Deductive Reasoning</li>
				<li>Creativity</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Deductive Reasoning</h3>
			<p>If i say to you, "The capital of Croatia is Zagreb", you could deduct that "The capital of Croatia is Dubrovnik" is wrong, this is called deductive reasoning, and it is the core of maths and physics, if Ai had this ability, it would allow it to be right 99,9% percent of times(the 0,01 are the things downstream of truths we never gave it).</p>
			<p>Allowing the training set to be a bunch of axioms would make it relatively quite small, make the individual development of ai easier</p>
			<h3>Creativity</h3>
			<p>Now, this one is possibly the hardest, we barely know what creativity is, but, i think the solution to it is approximation, one idea that is glued to my head ever since thought about it is that creativity is guided random thought generation, for example, when i'm thinking about what to write in this post, there is a random thought generator that is guided by "just think something that is related to advancement in ai", and it makes a googol of statements, but every one or two of them is reasonable and gets brought up to my mind</p>
