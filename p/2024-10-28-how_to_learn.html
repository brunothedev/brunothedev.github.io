			<h1>How to learn things by yourself</h1>
			<h3>Subdividing your topic</h3>
			<p>Use a LLM like chatgpt to subdivide your topic, this helps making what you need to learn more clearer and concrete.</p>
			<p>Some prompts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>"Tell me the main topics of X".</li>
				<li>"Subdivide X into as many topics as possible".</li>
				<li>"For everything i say here, make me a list of topics i have to learn with [ ] on each one, be as specific as possible"(my particular one, but you can test each and see what's best).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Then you use the output as a checklist.</p>
			<h3>Learning resources</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Wikipedia: Surprisingly useful, can give some bad explanations though.</li>
				<li><a href="https://libretexts.org/">Libretexts</a>: Very short textbooks.</li>
				<li>Youtube: Often use it when i'm stuck on something. Tip: 2x is a life(time?)-saver.</li>
				<li>Textbooks: You can find them freely by googling "[Thing X] pdf", please don't read them start to finish, just check what you need to learn with good old CTRL-F.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Just googling can get you far.</p>
			<h3>Anki</h3>
			<p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard">flashcard</a>(not the storage device kind) program that is my replacement to traditional note taking, here's how i use anki:</p>
			<p>I create a deck with a large scope(like physics), then i create a subdeck with a smaller scope(like classical mechanics), when i create a card, i use a Tag with a even smaller scope, like "Laws of Newton".</p>
